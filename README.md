## Overview

Welcome to our Restaurant Rating App! This is part of our Software Engineering course project, where we created a web-based admin panel for restaurant managers. Here, managers can manage their restaurant details and check out other restaurants in the same city. I worked on the front end using Flutter.

## Features

- **Admin Panel**: Manage your restaurant details and explore other restaurants in your city.
- **UI Design**: I designed the UI to be user-friendly and responsive.
- **API Integration**: The app connects to an API for smooth data management.
- **Firebase Deployment**: The app is currently deployed on Firebase for easy access.

## Challenges Faced

- **Responsiveness**: Making sure the web app looks good on all devices was quite the challenge.
- **UI Design**: Crafting an appealing and functional UI took a lot of planning and effort.
